# DIP-Project-Codes
This repository contains the complete implementation of my Digital Image Processing course project, which focuses on constructing a Goosefoot weed detection dataset using advanced image processing techniques and synthetic data generation. It includes Jupyter notebooks, datasets, and output results. The project uses ExG and Otsu methods for weed isolation, trains a stable diffusion model for generating synthetic weeds, segments soybean crops using the LeafOnlySAM model, and overlays weed images onto realistic crop backgrounds to create agricultural scenes. The final dataset is used to train a YOLOv12 model for Goosefoot detection
# Code Pipeline
The codes are used for a pipeline. This pipeline is used to generate more data, which will be used to train cutting-edge object detection models such as YOLO model.
